# EZ-Releasr
### Simple Photo Relase Solution

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Running with connection to the [EZ-Release Backend API](https://github.com/pbedrosian/ez-release-backend), users are able to crate, store, and share photo release PDF's to new clients. 

## Getting Stared

To start this applicaiton, clone this repo, along with the [EZ-Release Backend API](https://github.com/pbedrosian/ez-release-backend). You will need to set up the backend first, so please, go ahead with that and check back after that has been completed...

Oh, you're back! Now that you have a user set up, go ahrad and run 'npm i && npm start' to launch the applicaition in localhost:3000. 

Once that has been launched, feel free to start creating release forms.

### Future additions:
- Send Form to new Client
- User Accounts
- Ability to have database updated after user signs form
